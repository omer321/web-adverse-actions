Dear {{FIRST_NAME}},<br />
<br />
Your recent loan request on Prosper exceeds the amount your FICO®08 score and Prosper Score qualify you for. You are eligible to post a loan request for a lower loan amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prosper uses a credit scoring system that assigns a numerical value to the various items of information we consider in evaluating a listing request. These numerical values are based upon the results of analyses of repayment histories of large numbers of consumers. The information you provided resulted in credit scores that were below the minimums needed to post a listing. The reasons you did not score well compared with other applicants are:<br/><br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON1}}</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON2}}</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON3}}</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON4}}</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
In evaluating your application, we also obtained your FICO®08 credit score from Experian, a consumer reporting agency, and used it in making our credit decision. Experian played no part in our decision and is unable to supply specific reasons why we were unable to accept your loan request. You have a right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to know the information contained in your credit file at Experian.  You also have a right to a free copy of your report from Experian, if you request it no later than 60 days after you receive this notice. It can be obtained by contacting Experian at www.experian.com, 701 Experian Parkway, P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX  75013, toll-free telephone no. 1-888-397-3742. In addition, if you find that any information contained in the report you receive is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to dispute the matter with the reporting agency, Experian. <br/><br />
Your FICO®08 credit score is a number that reflects the information in your consumer report.  Your credit score can change, depending on how the information in your consumer report changes.<br />
<br />
Your credit score: {{INSERT_CREDIT_SCORE}}<br />
<br />
Date:  {{INSERT_CREDIT_PULLDATE}}<br />
<br />
The FICO&reg;08 credit score ranges from a low of 300 to a high of 850.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key factors that adversely affected your credit score:<br />
<ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON5}}</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON6}}</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON7}}</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 2em">{{REASON8}}</li>
